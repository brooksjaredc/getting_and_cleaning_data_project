==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

##For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

##The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

##Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

#Further Analysis by Jared Brooks
###In an R script I perform the following analysis. The structure is mirrored in the comments in the R script itself

## Reading, Labelling, and Merging
### This reads in the data, labels the columns, factors the activity labels, and merges the data in the first section


- Read in the feature names

- Read in test and train features and name columns using feature.names

- Row bind features.test and features.train

- Read in activity labels and test and train activity columns

- Row bind y.test and y.train

- Convert activities numbers into factors that describe the activity

- Column bind activities.factors to the features

- Read in subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt

- Row bind subject.test and subject.train, then Column bind result to features.activities

##Extracting Mean and Standard Deviation Columns

### Now we have our full, labeled, and factored data set.
### In the next section we extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

- Create boolean vector of columns that have "mean." or "std." in their names

- Change first two values of this vector to TRUE to keep subject and activity columns

- Create new table by subsetting the columns of full.data with means.and.stds

##Group By, Summarize, and Save

### Our data now only includes the measurements on the means and standard deviations
### In the next section we group by activites and subject, summarize to find the means of column for each activity
### and subject. Finally, we save this dataset to a file.

- Group by activities and subject, then use summarize_each to find the mean of all of the columns in avg.data

- Save the second dataset to file
